The aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful are gameplay, design, and concept/story. Gameplay consist of controls, the fun of the game, and optimization of game. If the gameplay is bad, players gonna leave the game or just not play the game which result in failure of game. Even if the gameplay is good, if the design, concept, and story are bad then people will lose interest in game.

Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because code have their own like specific syntex and if you don't follow it, it will cause an error. Making it precise will make it less time consuming, and if there is something missing it will not run at all or might have different output when you run the code. But I believe sometimes tweaking out some stuff while learning code because change some things will give you better understanding of how it works.

Protecting personal and sensitive information online is important because anything shared can be misused by others, leading to identity theft, fraud, or damage to your reputation. To keep your data secure, you should use privacy settings on platforms like GitHub and social media, make repositories private, and be careful about what you share. It's also essential to use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid oversharing personal details. Reflecting on my own experiences, I’ve learned to be more mindful of what I post to avoid sharing too much. While it's important to collaborate and be open online, maintaining privacy is key to protecting both personal and professional interests.

A current event is the growing use of AI tools like ChatGPT in education to help students learn and assist teachers. While these tools offer benefits like personalized learning, they also raise concerns about fairness, cheating, and unequal access to technology. Advancements in computer science, like creating more accessible AI tools and teaching students how to use them responsibly, could help address these challenges. Future improvements in AI could ensure that it supports education in a fair and ethical way, benefiting all students.

Technology has made food more affordable and accessible, especially during the holiday season, by improving farming with tools like automated machines and drones and making online grocery shopping and fast deliveries possible. Cold storage and better transportation ensure fresh food is available even in winter. However, relying on technology has downsides, like fewer jobs in traditional farming and risks of supply chain problems if systems fail, such as delays caused by cyberattacks or glitches during busy times.

One recent development in AI is its integration with quantum computing, particularly in the area of optimization problems. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds far beyond traditional computers. Recently, researchers have been using AI to improve quantum error correction, a key challenge in making quantum computers more practical. AI algorithms help optimize the vast and complex simulations necessary for quantum computing to reach its full potential, particularly in fields like cryptography, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Quantum AI could significantly accelerate discoveries and innovations in these areas.

The term “brain rot” resonates with me as a reflection of the overwhelming nature of modern digital consumption, particularly how easily it can erode our ability to focus on more enriching, deep activities. As we spend more time online, it’s easy to fall into a cycle of endless scrolling through shallow, often trivial content that may entertain us but doesn’t nourish our minds in any meaningful way. This year, I’ve noticed that, at times, my engagement with social media and other digital platforms has contributed to feelings of mental fatigue and distraction. While the internet offers convenience and connection, it also brings a constant influx of information that can feel overwhelming and ultimately leave little room for contemplation or focused, intentional learning.

Looking Back:

Things that I enjoyed the most is how free you are once you finish journal. Thing that could be improved is by adding some challenging problems to solve it could make the class more fun (the class is kinda boring).

Looking Ahead:

I would like to explore more into complex algorithms and data science.

Certifications:

Yes, I think giving us problems related to that certification would help me feel prepared.

The shift in the tech industry towards prioritizing artificial intelligence (AI) skills reflects the growing impact of AI on various sectors, signaling a need for adaptability and continuous learning. While this evolution offers immense potential to enhance opportunities by automating mundane tasks and empowering workers with advanced tools, it also risks limiting opportunities for those who lack access to upskilling resources. To thrive in a rapidly changing job market, I would focus on building a strong foundation in AI and machine learning, stay updated on emerging technologies, and develop complementary skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication. Combining technical expertise with a proactive mindset will allow me to adapt to advancements and seize opportunities in this dynamic industry.

**Journal: The TikTok Ban and Its Implications for Technology and Security**  

Government intervention in technology companies can have significant implications for both the companies and their users. For companies, it can lead to stricter regulations, increased scrutiny, and potential financial losses due to market restrictions. For users, government action can limit access to popular platforms, disrupt communities, and raise concerns about freedom of choice online. In the case of TikTok, the national security concerns tied to data collection and potential foreign surveillance underscore the importance of balancing technological innovation with robust privacy protections. This situation highlights the critical role governments play in safeguarding user data while also reminding us of the risks of overregulation, which could stifle creativity and limit global connectivity.  

To address security concerns while continuing to operate globally, companies like TikTok could implement enhanced transparency measures, such as allowing independent audits of their data handling practices. If I were a developer at TikTok, I would propose creating a feature that allows users to see exactly how their data is used and stored, with options to control the types of data collected. For instance, a "Data Dashboard" could give users a clear breakdown of collected data, explain how it is utilized, and allow users to opt out of specific data-sharing practices. This aligns with the principles of data privacy and software ethics we discussed in class, emphasizing user empowerment and trust. From this situation, I’ve learned the importance of designing applications with privacy as a core feature, not just a secondary consideration, a principle I can apply to my projects in this course to ensure ethical and secure app development.

Technology plays a critical role in aviation safety, particularly through air traffic control systems and automation. Modern air traffic control (ATC) systems use advanced computer algorithms to track and manage aircraft, reducing the risk of collisions by ensuring safe distances between planes. These systems rely on radar, GPS, and predictive modeling to monitor airspace in real time. However, when software glitches, outdated systems, or miscommunication occur, the consequences can be catastrophic. To enhance safety, integrating AI-driven automation could provide real-time collision detection and response, reducing human error and ensuring swift corrective actions in high-risk situations. 

Another crucial aspect of aviation safety is human-computer interaction (HCI), which impacts how pilots and air traffic controllers receive and interpret information. Poorly designed interfaces or unclear alert systems can lead to delayed or incorrect responses in critical moments. For instance, if warnings about potential collisions are not intuitive or require multiple steps to interpret, pilots may struggle to react in time. Improving HCI through more intuitive visual and audio alerts, standardized warning systems, and augmented reality (AR) displays could help pilots make faster, more informed decisions. By refining how humans interact with aviation technology, the risk of human error can be significantly reduced, leading to safer skies.
