The aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful are gameplay, design, and concept/story. Gameplay consist of controls, the fun of the game, and optimization of game. If the gameplay is bad, players gonna leave the game or just not play the game which result in failure of game. Even if the gameplay is good, if the design, concept, and story are bad then people will lose interest in game.

Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because code have their own like specific syntex and if you don't follow it, it will cause an error. Making it precise will make it less time consuming, and if there is something missing it will not run at all or might have different output when you run the code. But I believe sometimes tweaking out some stuff while learning code because change some things will give you better understanding of how it works.

Protecting personal and sensitive information online is important because anything shared can be misused by others, leading to identity theft, fraud, or damage to your reputation. To keep your data secure, you should use privacy settings on platforms like GitHub and social media, make repositories private, and be careful about what you share. It's also essential to use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid oversharing personal details. Reflecting on my own experiences, I’ve learned to be more mindful of what I post to avoid sharing too much. While it's important to collaborate and be open online, maintaining privacy is key to protecting both personal and professional interests.

A current event is the growing use of AI tools like ChatGPT in education to help students learn and assist teachers. While these tools offer benefits like personalized learning, they also raise concerns about fairness, cheating, and unequal access to technology. Advancements in computer science, like creating more accessible AI tools and teaching students how to use them responsibly, could help address these challenges. Future improvements in AI could ensure that it supports education in a fair and ethical way, benefiting all students.

Technology has made food more affordable and accessible, especially during the holiday season, by improving farming with tools like automated machines and drones and making online grocery shopping and fast deliveries possible. Cold storage and better transportation ensure fresh food is available even in winter. However, relying on technology has downsides, like fewer jobs in traditional farming and risks of supply chain problems if systems fail, such as delays caused by cyberattacks or glitches during busy times.

One recent development in AI is its integration with quantum computing, particularly in the area of optimization problems. Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds far beyond traditional computers. Recently, researchers have been using AI to improve quantum error correction, a key challenge in making quantum computers more practical. AI algorithms help optimize the vast and complex simulations necessary for quantum computing to reach its full potential, particularly in fields like cryptography, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Quantum AI could significantly accelerate discoveries and innovations in these areas.

The term “brain rot” resonates with me as a reflection of the overwhelming nature of modern digital consumption, particularly how easily it can erode our ability to focus on more enriching, deep activities. As we spend more time online, it’s easy to fall into a cycle of endless scrolling through shallow, often trivial content that may entertain us but doesn’t nourish our minds in any meaningful way. This year, I’ve noticed that, at times, my engagement with social media and other digital platforms has contributed to feelings of mental fatigue and distraction. While the internet offers convenience and connection, it also brings a constant influx of information that can feel overwhelming and ultimately leave little room for contemplation or focused, intentional learning.

I'm probably going to just program calculator for UIL Mathematics and maybe study for SAT or ap physics.

Looking Back:

Things that I enjoyed the most is how free you are once you finish journal. Thing that could be improved is by adding some challenging problems to solve it could make the class more fun (the class is kinda boring).

Looking Ahead:

I would like to explore more into complex algorithms and data science.

Certifications:

Yes, I think giving us problems related to that certification would help me feel prepared.
