Following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code because code have their own like specific syntex and if you don't follow it, it will cause an error. Making it precise will make it less time consuming, and if there is something missing it will not run at all or might have different output when you run the code. But I believe sometimes tweaking out some stuff while learning code because change some things will give you better understanding of how it works.

**Journal: The TikTok Ban and Its Implications for Technology and Security**  

Government intervention in technology companies can have significant implications for both the companies and their users. For companies, it can lead to stricter regulations, increased scrutiny, and potential financial losses due to market restrictions. For users, government action can limit access to popular platforms, disrupt communities, and raise concerns about freedom of choice online. In the case of TikTok, the national security concerns tied to data collection and potential foreign surveillance underscore the importance of balancing technological innovation with robust privacy protections. This situation highlights the critical role governments play in safeguarding user data while also reminding us of the risks of overregulation, which could stifle creativity and limit global connectivity.  

To address security concerns while continuing to operate globally, companies like TikTok could implement enhanced transparency measures, such as allowing independent audits of their data handling practices. If I were a developer at TikTok, I would propose creating a feature that allows users to see exactly how their data is used and stored, with options to control the types of data collected. For instance, a "Data Dashboard" could give users a clear breakdown of collected data, explain how it is utilized, and allow users to opt out of specific data-sharing practices. This aligns with the principles of data privacy and software ethics we discussed in class, emphasizing user empowerment and trust. From this situation, I’ve learned the importance of designing applications with privacy as a core feature, not just a secondary consideration, a principle I can apply to my projects in this course to ensure ethical and secure app development.

Technology plays a critical role in aviation safety, particularly through air traffic control systems and automation. Modern air traffic control (ATC) systems use advanced computer algorithms to track and manage aircraft, reducing the risk of collisions by ensuring safe distances between planes. These systems rely on radar, GPS, and predictive modeling to monitor airspace in real time. However, when software glitches, outdated systems, or miscommunication occur, the consequences can be catastrophic. To enhance safety, integrating AI-driven automation could provide real-time collision detection and response, reducing human error and ensuring swift corrective actions in high-risk situations. 

Another crucial aspect of aviation safety is human-computer interaction (HCI), which impacts how pilots and air traffic controllers receive and interpret information. Poorly designed interfaces or unclear alert systems can lead to delayed or incorrect responses in critical moments. For instance, if warnings about potential collisions are not intuitive or require multiple steps to interpret, pilots may struggle to react in time. Improving HCI through more intuitive visual and audio alerts, standardized warning systems, and augmented reality (AR) displays could help pilots make faster, more informed decisions. By refining how humans interact with aviation technology, the risk of human error can be significantly reduced, leading to safer skies.

Claim: I believe that 100 unarmed people could not defeat a silverback gorilla in a physical fight.
Evidence: A fully grown silverback gorilla can weigh over 400 pounds and has up to 10 times the strength of an average adult male. Gorillas also have incredible speed, strong jaws, and thick muscle mass, which makes them incredibly hard to stop. Even if the 100 people tried to use strategy, most would likely panic, and the first wave of people would face serious injury or death.
Reasoning: While the number might seem like an advantage, the group’s lack of training and coordination means they would likely be overwhelmed. This matters because it shows how people often underestimate nature and overestimate human ability, especially in hypothetical challenges that don’t take real-world consequences into account.

Claim: I don’t think it’s responsible to make this kind of challenge go viral.
Evidence: Although it may seem like harmless entertainment, suggesting a fight like “100 Men vs 1 Gorilla” could lead to misunderstandings about animal behavior, violence, or the idea that humans can dominate nature. It also turns a serious ethical issue—animal cruelty—into a joke.
Reasoning: This matters because viral trends shape how people think, especially young viewers. When creators blur the line between fantasy and reality, they risk spreading misinformation. The popularity of this trend shows how quickly outrageous ideas can gain attention online. It also reveals how entertainment is often mixed with education, but not always in a healthy or accurate way.

**Claim:** The “Chromebook Challenge” is not ethical and is extremely dangerous.
**Evidence:** Inserting foreign objects like pencils into USB ports can cause electrical shorts, fires, or permanent damage to the device. This kind of behavior puts students, teachers, and school property at risk. Schools invest thousands of dollars into technology to help students learn, not to have it ruined by reckless stunts. In some cases, students have even faced disciplinary action or had to pay for repairs.
**Reasoning:** This matters because being careless with technology shows a lack of respect for shared resources and safety. As future tech users and professionals, we should model smart, ethical behavior—especially in a school setting where others are affected by our choices.

**Claim:** It’s important to explain that this trend has real-world consequences, even if someone thinks it’s “just a joke.”
**Evidence:** Damaging a Chromebook can disrupt learning, waste taxpayer money, and even endanger lives if a fire starts. It could also lead to serious consequences like suspension or a permanent mark on a student’s record.
**Reasoning:** Helping others understand the impact of their actions is part of being a responsible digital citizen. Technology is a powerful tool, but it must be used wisely. Trends like this may seem funny in the moment, but the damage they cause is real—and preventable.
