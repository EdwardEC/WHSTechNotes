The aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful are gameplay, design, and concept/story. Gameplay consist of controls, the fun of the game, and optimization of game. If the gameplay is bad, players gonna leave the game or just not play the game which result in failure of game. Even if the gameplay is good, if the design, concept, and story are bad then people will lose interest in game.

Making it precise will make it less time consuming, and if there is something missing it will not run at all or might have different output when you run the code. But I believe sometimes tweaking out some stuff while learning code because change some things will give you better understanding of how it works.
